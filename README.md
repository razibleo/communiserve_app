The app was created during the COVID-19 period in reducing traffic at supermarkets, where people publish their locations along with their shopping lists who would like their community members who are going out shopping to help them get their grocery items.

Community members can see all of the shopping lists(referred to as requests) who reside nearby.  They see a map showing their location and markers dropped on locations around where they are. Each of these markers is someone in the community who have requests remaining that have not been taken. Clicking on the pin will then display all requests the user can accept. The community member can view the details of each request and decide to accept them or not. The marker may then change color to reflect the change in status from orange(open for anyone) to red indicating all requests by the users have been taken.

Once the request is fulfilled, the community member will be given points which can then later be redeemed for rewards(not implemented).
Money is transferred using bank transfers which are not part of this app.  A leaderboard is used to show the community members who contributed the most for rewards and appreciation later. 

<b>Please note that the app was designed as part of a project for Advanced Mobile Application Course.
It runs using the ionic framework through angular and information is stored on cloud firestore.</b>
